        No of course I do, but I don't believe in-game is the place for advertising. Ever.
        Especially since you kinda get the message *before* you've encountered any content Enlightend adds
        (except for the changed ender chest recipe, fog *incompatibility* with other mods,
        and the tiny specks of new stuff the worldgen has blessed the center end island with)

        Since you're reading this right now, and this minus-on wouldn't be possible without the original project existing,
        consider visiting https://www.patreon.com/lixir to support Enlightend.
